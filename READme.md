# About ARTificial 💻 

This project was made by both me and @nickd16 during the 2023 TCNJ Hackathon. My partner Nick was reponsible for creating the AI part of the project, and I was responsible for implementing the web-based part of the project. For the AI part, Nick designed an algorithm that takes the content of an image (buildings, people, equipment, food, etc) and the style of another image (pop art, cubism, abstract), and combines the two to make one image. To do this he used nueral style transfer made from scratch using VGG19. For the design of the website we decided to bring life to the ai program, and call it ARTificial. The website displays ARTificial's artistic ability on 4 different art styles; pop art, cubism, fantasy, and impressionism. Another feature of the website also allows the user to input any two images from their computer and gets back a combination of the two through ARTificial
